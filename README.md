# React Debugging Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the React Debugging Challenge! This project is a basic React application that functions as a to-do list. However, there are a few intentional bugs that need to be identified and fixed. This challenge is designed to test your understanding of React fundamentals, including components, state management, and event handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (Download from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/))
- A code editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or Atom)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/ppsdang/react-debugging-challenge](https://github.com/ppsdang/react-debugging-challenge)

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd react-debugging-challenge

3. Install the required dependencies:
npm install


### Running the Application
1. Start the development server:
npm start

2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the app.

## Your Task
Your goal is to debug and fix the issues in the application. The application should allow users to:
1. Add new tasks to the to-do list.
2. Display the list of tasks.
3. Prevent the addition of empty tasks.

## Debugging Tips
- Read through the code in `TodoList.js` and `TodoService.js` to understand the logic.
- Pay attention to how state and props are used.
- Check for any syntax or logical errors.
- Use browser developer tools for debugging JavaScript and inspecting the DOM.
